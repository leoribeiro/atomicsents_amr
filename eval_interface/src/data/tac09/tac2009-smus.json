[{"instance_id": "d0901-A", "summary": "Since they became separate nations in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the Himalayan province which was split between them.  Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province, and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began, the first tangible result of the peace talks.During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years.A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005.There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders.", "tree": ["(f / fight-01\n   :ARG0 (c / country\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1

the morning-after pill. When used within 72 hours after intercourse, the drug prevents pregnancy. Barr Pharmaceuticals proposed that the FDA allow girls age 16 or older to obtain the drug over the counter. Proponents claimed it would be invaluable in preventing unplanned pregnancies. Opponents argued that the pill causes abortion, which they strongly oppose. Medical authorities disputed this. Conservatives feared its use would make young girls more promiscuous. Research following 2,000 California girls found that those who used the pill were not more likely to have unprotected sex.Introduction of the \"morning-after pill\" led to much controversy over its use and distribution. Some groups considered it a form of abortion while others argued it was not. Some said it encouraged teen-age sex while scientific studies indicated it did not. The pill was available by prescription only. Proponents argued for its sale \"over the counter\" (OTC). Opponents said this would encourage teen-age sex. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a proposal for OTC sales in May 2004. In January 2005 it continued to consider OTC sales to women 16 years or older.Debate continues on over-the-counter availability of the \"morning after pill.\" US supporters consider it safe and effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Those opposed, especially the Bush administration and the religious right, consider the pill an abortion, interference with \"natural law\", and promoting promiscuity. Two studies found it did not increase sexual activity, but also did not decrease pregnancies. The DEA is expected to decide soon whether the pill can be dispensed over the counter to those 16 and older. Also debated is whether pharmacists may refuse to fill prescriptions for this pill. Other nations are also concerned.The conflict over approval of the morning-after pill continues. Both sides consider the drug safe and effective. Opponents claim that such accessability would encourage teens to have sex. Supporters say that it would reduce the number of teenage pregnancies significantly. The Bush Administration has promoted abstinence-only education and a top FDA official rejected nonprescription sales, overruling the strong recommendation of FDA scientific advisers. Six states allow nonprescription sales of the drug. Now there is a proposal that to make the pill available without prescription to those 16 and older, but to require younger teens to consult a physician.", "tree": ["(a / approve-01\n   :ARG0 (g /

"With rising prices of natural gas and oil, interest is increasing in alternative fuels. The market for solar power is expected by some to grow 35% a year in the next five years. Earlier, $20,000, the minimum cost to install a home solar-power system, was too high; but now higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utilities help reduce that cost. California has many solar electricity systems already in operation. Interest is widespread. Portugal plans the world's biggest solar energy power station. Taiwan claims the best silicon solar cell plant. Italy has Europe's first solar-powered train.Spain loaned the Philippines $4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households, schools, potable water systems, and health centers. Portugal planned to begin work on the world's biggest solar power station in 2006. The project, built by BP, was expected to create 240 jobs. The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy. Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning, illumination, and safety systems. Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power.Interest in solar power is increasing with large scale projects planned in Portugal and the Philippines. Large energy giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in producing equipment. The agricultural valleys of California are considered favorable for solar power. Home conversions to solar power will probably require subsidies to offset initial costs but will lead to low monthly bills. Improvements in semiconductors will aid solar development. Solar panels on trains in Italy and Japan provide for air conditioning, illumination and safety systems. Solar cars and backpacks have been developed.Expectations are high for the growth of solar power. Petroleum industry officials warn solar could become competitive by 2015. In the US, the solar market is expected to grow by 35% a year. In California, production increased from 10 megawatts in 2001 to 100 in 2005. In New York, demand for home systems skyrocketed this year. Portugal is planning a 62 megawatt power station for completion in 2009. In the Philippines, a $63.1 million project is bringing power to rural areas. Taiwan is developing the solar industry chain. Other projects include solar powered trains, cars, and backpack battery chargers.", "tree": ["(ii / increase-01\n    :ARG1 (ii2 / interest-01\n               :ARG2 (f / fuel\n

A U.S. plan to build 130 turbines in the ocean south of Cape Cod is meeting strong opposition from residents of nearby resorts who say the turbines would spoil the view, disrupt fishing and harm birds.The first US offshore wind turbine plan was in Nantucket Sound. Opponents of offshore wind power sought a more comprehensive strategy for wind energy and argued it would spoil vacation area aesthetics, disrupt commercial fishing and harm birds and marine life. One study found the proposal would have little effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life or fishing conditions. Another study concluded the turbines could alter local weather. Fishermen opposed clusters of windmills on Spain's southern shore because they would disturb tuna migration and necessitate dangerous detours.Proponents of wind turbine generated power consider it a safe, pollution free, way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It counteracts global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and preserves oil and natural gas resources. They contend there is no harm to the local environment and even attract sightseers. Opponents primarily consider wind farms to be a blight on the landscape that lowers property values, tourism and jobs. They expect off shore farms to disrupt commercial shipping, harm birds and marine life, and impact sport and commercial fishing. Land-based farms are deemed to affect local weather, vegetation and wildlife.Proponents of wind power assert that it is a safe, non-polluting, renewable alternative to fossil fuel. Opponents say that the turbines are ugly, disrupt fishing, harm birds and marine wildlife, and affect local weather. Wind power is widely used in Europe, both on land and offshore. Now the first U.S. off-shore wind farm has been proposed for Nantucket Sound. Opponents emphasize the aesthetic impact of the project, while a draft environmental report said that it would not hinder commercial or sport activities nor would it kill birds or fish or affect currents, water quality, or noise levels.", "tree": ["(l / lead-02\n   :ARG0 (c / continent\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1 \"Europe\"))\n   :ARG1 (w / way)\n   :ARG2 (p /

sleet, rain and fog caused a 200-vehicle logjam. A fourth day of storms took a heavy toll as saturated hillsides gave way, mudslides inundating houses and closing highways. People fled neighborhoods up and down the coast. Eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita were canceled for the first time in 10 years. More than 6,000 houses were without power in Los Angeles. A scientist said Los Angeles had not seen such intensity of winter downpours since 1889-90.Southern California was drenched by rainstorms in January 2005. Los Angeles had 15 inches in the first nine days. The rains caused severe flooding, sinkholes and mudslides resulting in huge property losses, blocked roads, power outages, hundreds of auto accidents, interruptions of rail traffic, and, by Jan. 10th, twenty deaths. Heroic efforts by hundreds of overtaxed rescue workers saved thousands from collapsed houses, mud piles and floodwaters. Sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs searched for signs of life in mountains of mud and debris. By Jan 12th good weather was forecast for later in the week.Record-breaking rains brought danger and destruction to southern California in the first weeks of 2005. The early January storms dropped more rain in Los Angeles than its average annual amount. Several thousand residents endured power outages. Conditions necessitated widespread evacuations. Landslides, mudslides, floods and downed trees caused massive destruction of homes and roads. Stranded motorists required rescue by overtaxed emergency workers. Schools, businesses, rail lines and roads were closed. Beaches were closed for sewage leaks. The number of traffic accidents tripled from the previous dry weekend. In all, the storms caused at least 20 deaths and dozens of injuries.Southern California was been drenched by storms beginning in late December 2004, the heaviest drenching in nearly 40 years. Over 15 inches fell during the first nine days of January. The storm resulted in human deaths and injuries. It created flooding, mudslides, and rockslides which caused power outages, evacuations, and disruption of rail services. Beaches, state parks and some mountain and ski resorts were closed. The National Weather Service said this system occurs only every 5-10 years. The extraordinary weather was attributed to a confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a cold front from the North.", "tree": ["(u / use-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :ARG0-of (w

Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel 2001-2003. He drafted memos concerning the President's authority to wage preemptive war, the Geneva Convention, and torture. A Sept. 25, 2001 secret memo argued that President Bush had authority to wage preemptive war to protect the United Sates without Congressional approval. Other memos redefined torture and advised President Bush that the Geneva Convention does not apply to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Yoo is also a regular contributor to opinion pages of major newspapers.John Yoo is a constitutional scholar and law professor at UC Berkeley. He is a prolific writer and a regular contributor to opinion pages of major newspapers. As a Justice Department lawyer from 2001 to 2003, Yoo helped write a series of controversial memos to the White House following the 9/11 attacks. One memo concluded that the president has the authority to wage preemptive war. Another advised that the Geneva Convention does not apply to al-Qaida and Taliban non-state terror organizations. Yoo believes the US should not divulge which interrogation methods short of torture it might use with terror suspects.As deputy assistant attorney general with the Office of Legal Counsel in 2001, John C. Yoo wrote a secret memo concluding Bush had authority to wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if not linked to 9/11 attacks. In 2002 he wrote much of the memo saying the Geneva Convention did not apply to al-Qaida, a non-state terror organization. He said rules of war have changed because the enemy has changed. Our leaders can decide what system to apply. He denied that the White House influenced OLC advice. Yoo returned to teaching law at UC Berkeley after leaving government.John Yoo, a conservative Justice Department lawyer in the Bush Administration, helped write a series of legal memos stating that there were no limits on the President's power to wage war and redefining torture, saying that the Geneva Convention does not apply to the treatment of terrorists. Yoo asserted that these tightly held memos would not convert to orders for soldiers to violate human rights. He insisted that the White House had not dictated or influenced the content of the memos. He believed that interrogation methods should not be disclosed because terrorists could then train people to resist such methods.", "tree": ["(s / serve-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n

China announced its respect for the choice of the Nepalese, but later condemned its Maoist rebels. On Feb. 2 the European Union condemned the King's action and called for a \"speedy\" return to multi-party democracy. On Feb. 3 Pakistan's Prime Minister opined that recent developments were Nepal's internal matters while Japan voiced concern and urged a return to democracy.The US faced a policy challenge resulting from the unexpected action of Nepal's King Gyanendra in dissolving the government and claiming absolute power. The king claimed it was necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of Maoist insurgency. The US, Britain and India who provide aid to Nepal have widely condemned the king's action. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern and the European Union joined the international condemnation of Gyanendra's action. Japan, another aid donor to Nepal, voiced concern at the power grab. China called the action \"an internal affair\" and Pakistan adopted the same approach.Nepali King Gyanendra's power grab added to the regional sense that Nepal is in a downward spiral. The US, UN, EU, India and Britain condemned the move as a setback for democracy. The US and India have made no decision on continuation of military aid they were providing to Nepal in its struggle against rebels. Top Nepali aid donor Japan urged peace through dialogue. India wants to minimize links between Nepal's and India's rebels. PM Singh canceled his attendance at a summit in Bangladesh, which was postponed in response. Pakistan and China remained neutral. Human rights groups condemned both sides.Most countries, including the U.S., Britain, India, and Japan, have condemned Nepali King Gyanendra's seizure of power. The U.S. has not yet decided whether to continue its military and development aid. India has not yet commented on its military aid but is expected to continue to support Nepal's fight against the Maoist rebels. Both the E.U. and the U.N. condemned the move and called for an immediate return to multi-party democracy. International organizations including Amnesty International have denounced the suspension of civil liberties. China alone remained neutral, maintaining that this was an \"internal matter.\"", "tree": ["(c / condemn-01\n   :ARG0 (a / and\n            :op1 (c2 / country\n                     :name (n / name\n

due to violent activity by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). An appeal in April 2005 by Sinn Fein leader Adams to the IRA to abandon armed struggle was endorsed in May by Irish Prime Minister Ahern. All interested parties awaited a response from the IRA. In late June the U.S. State Department supported British Prime Minister Blair's and Ahern's call for a response. In late July there was a first glimmer of hope as three senior Sinn Fein leaders resigned from the ruling body of IRA's military wing.Irish PM Ahern said the main goal of the US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998, a joint Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland, could be revived only with a complete end of IRA weapons use. The landmark peace deal led to a virtual end of violence in that area. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has appealed to IRA members to end their armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will disarm. British PM Blair and Ahern will chair a review of the Northern Ireland situation in London.The US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 ended three decades of violence and created a power-sharing plan in Northern Ireland. It required a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality, and decommissioning of IRA weapons. Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following continued IRA underground activities. In 2005 Gerry Adams, leader of Catholic Sinn Fein, appealed to IRA members to give up violence in favor of democratic methods, followed by similar appeals by Irish PM Bertie Ahern and Protestant party leader Ian Paisley. Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris resigned from the IRA paramilitary council, severing its political and military wings.The 1998 Good Friday Peace accord had proposed a joint Catholic-Protestant administration, including the Sinn Fein, for Northern Ireland. Although ending decades of fighting, power sharing collapsed in 2002 because of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) - the military arm of the Sinn Fein - activities and failure to disarm. In 2005, British and Irish leaders sought to restore the power sharing institutions. Protestants insisted the IRA disband and disarm. Protestant leaders was urged to come onboard the peace process. On August 23, three Sinn Fein leaders resigned from leadership positions in the IRA, severing their military ties.", "tree": ["(s / suspend-01\n   :ARG1 (a / accord-03\n            :ARG1 (p / peace)\n

"d0910-A", "summary": "In October 2004, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebel group blamed the government for delay in reviving negotiations to end the conflict that had claimed 60,000 lives since 1972. The rebels themselves suspended talks in April 2003 when internecine struggles broke out between rebel groups. The government claims the Tigers are holding up negotiations and accuses them of killing over 250 of their political rivals since the truce of 2002 went into effect. The government released ten Tamil Tigers from jail on bail, and the rebels responded by freeing two homeguards who had been held hostage since August.Negotiations under the Norwegian-sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government of Sri Lanka were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within the LTTE. The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004. While LTTE sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations, Sri Lanka blamed LTTE for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003.A group from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with the Sri Lankan government. A cease in that country brokered by Norway has been observed since February 2002; however, internecine clashes between the LTTE and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between the government and the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by the LTTE. Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed. Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka to push for resumption of talks.Efforts to revive talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings. In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks, while the government said that it had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations. Japan's special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka on 27 October for a 7-day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks. Japan is optimistic and has promised continued assistance for the country's reconstruction.", "tree": ["(b / blame-01\n   :ARG0 (g / group\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1

2005 for trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport. Japan planned to deport him to the U.S., where he was wanted for ignoring sanctions against Yugoslavia. It meant 10 years in jail. Iceland intervened, and Japan agreed not to deport Fischer if Iceland would give him citizenship. Iceland furnished him a special passport and residency permit. Japan insisted on full citizenship, which was finally granted. Iceland revered Fischer because it was there that he defeated Boris Spassky, the Russian chess champion, in 1972, during the cold war.Bobby Fischer, held in detention in Japan in March 2005 awaiting deportation to the U.S., could achieve asylum in Iceland if granted Icelandic citizenship. He was given residency status, but Iceland's parliament had rejected citizenship in February. Several Icelandic politicians indicated on March 16 that parliament was likely to grant citizenship. A parliamentary committee which reached no decision on March 17 saying they were awaiting more documents from Japan, voted in favor of citizenship on March 18. On March 21 parliament voted in favor 40-0 with two abstentions and 21 absent.Chess legend Bobby Fischer has been held in detention in Japan for eight months after trying to leave Tokyo on a revoked US passport. He faces deportation and prison in the US for violating sanctions on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992. Supporters worked to secure his passage to Iceland, where he is revered as a national hero for beating Boris Spassky there in 1972. Iceland's parliament granted Fischer a foreigner's passport and a residency permit. But, that was not enough. After receiving assurance that Icelandic citizenship would enable Japan to free Fischer, parliament granted it to him.Bobby Fischer can avoid deportation from Japan to the US if Iceland upgrades its granting residency to full citizenship. Fischer is popular in Iceland where he beat the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky to become world chess champ in 1972. Fischer faces charges in the US for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia for playing there in 1992, and possibly for tax evasion. Fischer wants to marry the head of Japan's chess association. Since leaving the US, Fischer has ranted against the US and Jews. The Icelandic Parliament has granted citizenship to Fischer where he is expected to reside.", "tree": ["(a / arrest-01\n   :ARG1 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1

whose soldier son was killed in Iraq, formed the anti-war group Gold Star Families For Peace in early 2005. She was turned away while trying to protest the Iraq War at the Pentagon and although she spoke out across the nation it was her roadside vigil near President Bush's Texas ranch that gained the attention of the nation and the world. Beginning on Aug. 6, 2005 she vowed to maintain the vigil until Bush spoke with her or finished his August vacation. By August 11 neither Bush nor Sheehan had given in.Following her son's April 2004 death in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan has made regular public appearances across the nation protesting the war. She co-founded Gold Star Families for Peace. On August 8, 2005, Sheehan led an antiwar protest down the road leading to President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas. She and about 50 antiwar activists established a roadside camp not far from the ranch, vowing to remain until Bush met with her. She used the internet to garner publicity. By August 11, several dozen protesters from across the country had joined Sheehan at Camp Casey, named for her fallen son.When her son was killed in Iraq Cindy Sheehan launched an anti-war campaign. She made public appearances to oppose the war and founded the anti-war group, Gold Star Families for Peace. She received support from anti-war groups in Washington and spoke with Democratic Congressmen. She traveled to Texas with anti-war activists to seek a meeting with President Bush at his Ranch. She was denied a meeting and camped near the Bush ranch, saying she would remain there until Bush met with her. Leading anti-war activists joined her protest in Texas and she received liberal Internet support.After her son died in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan began protesting the war. She founded the Gold Star Families for Peace and began making appearances and leading protests around the country. On August 6, 2005, she led protestors to Crawford, Texas, demanding to meet with the President. Two officials met with her, but she set up a vigil and swore to continue until Bush personally met with her, even if she had to go to Washington. This protest drew world-wide media attention and garnered support from other anti-war activists. She took her protest to the internet with a conference with bloggers.", "tree": ["(f / form-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1 \"Cindy\"\n

government buildings violates the principle of separation of church and state. Two cases from Texas and Kentucky raised several questions. Are the T.C. a religious statement, a part of legal history, or both? If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely.On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the display of the Ten Commandments on government property. In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June.A homeless man, Thomas Van Orden, in Texas is challenging the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and two stars of David on the Capitol grounds. A Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses. Opponents of the displays argue the displays violate the First Amendments prohibition on establishing an official state religion. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one. The Bush administration has argued on behalf of the displays. Questioning by justices during hearings suggests they are headed for a split decision.The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings. Justice O'Connor is expected to cast the swing votes.", "tree": ["(f / face-01\n   :ARG0 (g / government-organization\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1 \"Supreme\"\n

At least 30 people were killed and at least 100 were wounded. Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing information about possible attacks. The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip. The previously unheard of World Islamist Group claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton Hotel blast, saying it was in revenge for Palestinians and Arabs killed in Palestine and Iraq.Explosions rocked three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with Israelis. The largest explosion occurred in the Taba Hilton just across the Israeli border and the other two in nearby villages. The explosions followed warnings from Israeli Intelligence to keep out of the Sinai Desert. It is not clear how many were killed and wounded in the blasts. Several conflicting casualty numbers were reported. There were no official reports about the cause of the blasts, but police believe they were caused by car bombs. The World Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the Taba explosion but it cannot be verified.Three explosions shook Egyptian resorts popular with vacationing Israelis. At least 35 people were killed and 100 wounded. Initially reported as a gas leak, the largest explosion may have been a truck bomb driven into the Taba Hilton across the border from the Israeli resort town of Eilat. Two other explosions took place to the southwest at Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba. At least seven died at the former, most Egyptian workers. A previously unknown group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton bombing. Shin Bet intelligence service had advised Israelis not to go Sinai resorts during holidays.In October 2004, three terrorist car bombs shook Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis, killing 35 (including 23 Israelis) and wounding 125. A powerful car bomb close to the entrance of the Taba Hilton destroyed much of the hotel. Two hours later two vans exploded at tourist camps in Ras Satan (Ras al-Sultan) and Nueiba. Seven died at Ras al-Sultan, mostly Egyptian workers. The previously unknown World Islamist Group claimed responsibility. The attack occurred Thursday night at the close of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, amid an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip that left 93 Palestinians dead.", "tree": ["(r / rip-01\n   :ARG0 (b /

Thursday's attacks killed at least 19 and included a car bombing near Samarra and three blasts in Basra. Forty-five polling stations were attacked across Iraq on Friday. At least six were killed. Attacks occurred around Kirkuk, Baghdad, Al-Dur, Tikrit, and Shorgat. On Saturday, several polling stations were struck, but no large-scale insurgent offensive materialized. A suicide bomber of al-Zarqawi's al-Qaida network attacked a station in Khanaqin. Other attacks occurred in Baghdad, Ramadi, Kirkuk, Baiji, and Moqdadiya. At least 18 were killed on Saturday.Three days before Sunday's election, 40 polling stations were already destroyed. Most were empty and casualties were low. Polling station attacks escalated Thursday through Saturday but no large-scale offensive materialized. Violence was concentrated in the Sunni heartland. Polling stations were attacked with homemade bombs, car bombs, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire. Two police guards were shot dead. The worst attacks were a car bomb in Samarra that hit a nearby Iraqi army patrol, killing seven; and a Zarqawi-connected suicide bomber who approached a Khanaqin polling station and set off a blast that killed eight, including three soldiers.In the days leading up to the January 30, 2005 elections in Iraq, more than 100 of the more than 5,000 polling places across the nation were attacked, with many of those destroyed. Although 400 Iraqi were reportedly killed in January as part of the anti-election campaign, casualties at the polling places were limited because many were empty. The attacks ranged from car-suicide bombers, to small bombs, mortars and bullets, to posters and pamphlets. The threats to the polling places came from guerilla and militant groups, to include Al-Qaeda and mujahedeen factions. They promised more violence on election day.Despite heavy security measures, scores of attacks targeted Iraqi polling places throughout the country in the days preceding the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, with some 40 polling stations destroyed. Casualties, including Iraqi policemen, soldiers, a child, and a woman, were low because most of the buildings were not occupied. The attacks struck polling places in Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk, Al-Dur, Baiji, Shorgat, and Moqdadiya. Violence is expected to escalate on Sunday and continue after the elections. Many Sunnis are expected to boycott the elections, but a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds.", "tree": ["(d / destroy-01\n   :ARG0 (ii / insurgent)\n   :ARG1 (s / station\n

introduced in 1996. New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days. On the morning of April 18, 2005, Cardinal Ratzinger, a prominent contender for pope, delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy. That afternoon, after the first voting session, a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof, which would indicate election of a pope, turned to black, showing that no decision had been made.On Sunday, April 17, 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents arrived at the Vatican to select a successor to Pope John Paul II. On Monday, they convened a conclave, a secret and sacred gathering, in the Sistine Chapel. Following the cardinals' oath, the selection process began. A two-thirds majority is required to elect a pope. Outside, attention was focused on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke of burning ballots that would indicate a successful election. Monday, black smoke rose from the chimney. The cardinals would return twice daily, beginning Tuesday, for additional ballots.The conclave was introduced to inconvenience cardinals and thus speed up the process. Today it helps preserve secrecy. The opening pageant is televised, then all news media and audiovisual or communication equipment is banned. Cardinals move into St. Martha's House and are forbidden to talk to anyone not sworn to secrecy. In 1996 John Paul II instituted new rules concerning choosing a pope. Until a two-thirds majority is reached the pattern is seven ballots and a day of rest. If a deadlock remains after 12 days, voting may resort to simple majority. Bells will ring when a pope is elected.On April 18, 2005, 115 cardinals, all under 80, were sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new pope. After a televised mass, they took an oath of secrecy, then moved to the Sistine Chapel, which had been swept for bugs and contained electronic jammers. They meet twice a day, voting twice each session, until one man receives a 2/3's majority. After each vote the ballots are burned - black smoke signals no one was elected. When a pope is chosen, white smoke will be accompanied by bells. Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square watched the first ballot's black smoke.", "tree": ["(g / govern-01\n   :ARG0 (r / rule\n            :age (m / multiple\n                    :op1 (t / temporal-quantity\n

a brilliant, visionary woman who came to prominence in 1963 with publication of her book, The Feminine Mystique. The wildly popular book brought about a re-examination of women's role in society. Friedan found that many women were not content with lives of domesticity, and she campaigned for greater access to work outside the home. She was the first president of the National Organization for Women and a leader in the drive to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She was abrasive, and some feminists criticized her for ignoring concerns of women of color, lesbians and the poor.In 1963 Betty Friedan wrote a provocative book, The Feminine Mystique, that ignited the feminist movement. The book exposed American women's discontent with domesticity and workplace discrimination. Friedan started an international movement. She founded and was elected president of NOW. She helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and a group that later became NARAL. For two decades she led demonstrations, protest marches, and news conferences. Her moderate belief that women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men caused a split with other feminist leaders and her relegation to the sidelines in the late 1970's.Betty Friedan's 1963 controversial bestseller \"The Feminine Mystique\" made her the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement. Her pioneering book identified the unhappiness of post-WWII American women unfulfilled by traditional domesticity. She was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and pushed for legal abortion. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was its first president, splitting with them over their emphasis on lesbian issues and alienating men. She led the 1970 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality. She was a founder of the Women's Political Caucus and NARAL. She wrote \"The Second Stage\" in 1981.Betty Friedan's 1963 classic \"The Feminine Mystique\" started a social revolution that led to the modern women's movement. It was included in Human Events magazine's list of the \"Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th centuries.\" Frieden helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1970, she led a 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality down Fifth Avenue. Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, and other topics considered radical at the time.", "tree": ["(w / woman\n   :ARG1-of

Islam sold 50 million records in the 60s and 70s. He converted to Islam in the late 70s, abandoning his career and devoting himself to philanthropy. Later, learning the Koran does not ban music, he traveled to the U.S to cut a record. Making a follow-up trip, he was detained.

Jackson pleaded not guilty. One of several searches of locations linked to Jackson seized the top layer of a mattress used in his mansion. A DNA swab from Jackson's mouth was taken the same day. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled for Jan. 31, 2005. During 2004 Jackson asked that the prosecutor be removed, led a protest against rapper Eminem, faced charges of non-payment of bills, and received an e-mail death threat.Michael Jackson's woes are many since his arrest for child molestation. He's suing XtraJet for videotaping his conversations with his lawyer. There's upheaval in his legal team since he fired two attorneys, hired one, and another took leave. Jackson's attorneys accused District Attorney Tom Sneddon of having a vendetta against him. Prosecutors alleged Jackson plotted to kidnap his accuser. In one week, Jackson was hit with two non-payment lawsuits. A rapper's video mocked Jackson and angered him, and he received a death threat. Investigators launched another search of Neverland Ranch, which frightened his children, and took a DNA sample.In November 2003 police arrested Michael Jackson on several counts of child molestation after having raided his California ranch. Jackson's attorney accused the District Attorney of having a vendetta against Jackson and alleged in a lawsuit that private conversations used as evidence had been illegally recorded. Jackson had problems with his legal team. Rapper Eminem issued a video showing a Jackson look-alike on a bed with children. A former business associate seeking $3 million sued for breach of contract and a merchant sued to collect nearly $180,000. In December 2003 investigators searched Jackson's ranch and took DNA from his mouth.Michael Jackson is having a rough time. His long-time attorney Steve Cochran left the defense team for unknown reasons. Eminem made a music video showing a Jackson look-alike in bed with children. He has been sued for three million dollars by a former business associate for breach of contract and for $180,000 by an antique store for unpaid bills. And a Canadian pleaded guilty to emailing a death threat to Jackson. Another search was made of Jackson's Neverland Ranch on 3 December and the following day investigators took DNA samples from Jackson's mouth.", "tree": ["(a2 / arrest-01\n    :ARG1 (p / person\n

That law, passed after September 11, gave broad powers to government agencies to obtain information for fighting terrorism. They argued the Patriot Act has prevented further attacks. A coalition of conservatives and liberals organized to demand changes, believing the Act endangered individual freedom. The groups challenged provisions giving access to library, medical and firearm-ownership records; allowing secret searches; and allowing surveillance of protests. Earlier, a judge disallowed forcing Internet providers to turn over records.The Patriot Act included major sections that expire in 2005 if not renewed by Congress. The Bush administration calls for complete renewal, but liberals and some conservatives maintain that the law gives the federal government too much power. Bush threatens to veto any congressional weakening of the Act. The specific sections are targeted by an unusual left-right coalition. The sections attacked are: the one permitting easy access to records in terrorism-related cases; the provision for \"sneak and peek\" secret searches before a warrant is presented; and an overbroad definition of \"terrorists\" that could include non-terrorist suspects.Weeks after 911 Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. The Act expanded Federal law enforcement officials' surveillance and prosecution power against suspected terrorists. Key elements of the Act were to expire at the end of 2005. Congress had to decide whether to renew them. The Bush administration argued that the Act had kept America safe and sought to retain all elements. Opponents argued that the Act undermined freedom and gave the federal government too much power. Groups opposed to the renewal of the Act formed a coalition, Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, to lobby Congress to repeal key provisions.President Bush, the outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft and his deputy, James Comfey, have promoted the Patriot Act. The President and incoming Attorney General Gonzales have called for it extension. Ashcroft's speeches promoting of the Act have not violated anti-lobbying rules. The liberal American Civil Liberties Union and conservative libertarian groups have joined forces to oppose giving government access to library and medical records. A US district judge ruled that a provision of the Patriot Act that enabled federal authorities to force Internet service providers to provide subscriber information violated the First and Fourth Amendments.", "tree": ["(b / begin-01\n   :ARG0 (g / government-organization\n            :ARG0-of (a / administrate-01)\n            :mod (p / person\n                    :name (n / name\n

"The so-called Real ID Act was attached to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. Consequently, legislators had little time to debate the bill before passing it. Only driver's licenses from complying states will be valid for air travel and other official identification purposes. The law would deny licenses to illegal immigrants and would significantly raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum-seekers. Proponents expect greater homeland security. Opponents say the law is anti-immigrant and would add cost and delays to DMV processes. Civil libertarians argue it creates a de facto national ID card and threatens individual privacy.The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 must-pass Iraq Appropriations bill, bypassing hearings and debate. The Act contains provisions aimed at keeping terrorists from crossing US borders. The most controversial would make it hard for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and possibly require a national ID card. States would need to add security features to driver's licenses and create license databases. Most Americans detested the idea. The ACLU tried to stop the bill. Opponents viewed it as a blatant attack on immigrants' rights and did not believe it would improve US security.House Judiciary Committee Sensenbrenner attached his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. The bill would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and that it would protect against terrorist entry into the US. Civil libertarians oppose the bill on grounds that it would create a de facto national ID card. The measure may run counter to the president's support for a temporary guest worker program. States fear the act would add another unfunded federal mandate on them and create delays at motor vehicle bureaus. Immigrant rights groups oppose the Act.The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 Iraq appropriations bill without legislative review. It is intended to stop illegal aliens from having driver's licenses to use to board airplanes and enter public buildings, raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum seekers, and build a fence on the border near Tijuana, Mexico. Opponents fear the act will create a national ID card; impinge on states' powers; give untrained workers responsibility for immigration control; gridlock the license process; increase unlicensed, uninsured drivers; deny qualified asylum seekers; harm the environment; and cost five times what is expected.", "tree": ["(a / attach-01\n   :ARG1 (l / law\n            :name (n / name\n

arthritis drug Vioxx from the market in 2004 after a trial showed it increased heart attacks and strokes. Merck's net income plunged 29% after the announcement. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration announced they would review all COX-2 inhibitors to see if there was a class effect. Hundreds, possibly thousands of lawsuits were likely to be filed against Merck, lawyers said, including many class action lawsuits, all claiming injury from taking Vioxx. Plaintiffs' cases were strengthened when proof was uncovered that Merck knew about Vioxx's risk but discounted it.Merck withdrew Vioxx when a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks. An FDA study estimates Vioxx may have caused 27,785 attacks/deaths since its approval. The medical community was concerned about use of related drug use and sought more guidance. Lawyers estimated thousands of lawsuits would be filed against Merck. One settlement estimate was $12 billion. Merck's costs to withdraw Vioxx from the market were $552.6 million and their profits for the third quarter of 2004 dropped 29 percent. Several medical reports criticized Merck's failing to stop Vioxx when data first showed its potential danger.Merck has recalled its popular arthritis medicine Vioxx. Use of Vioxx may increase risk of stroke and heart attack. This is the largest prescription drug recall in history and could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits. Vioxx is used by 1.3 million Americans and 700,000 in other countries and accounts for sales of $2.5B. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canadian Provinces. Hundreds of plaintiffs lawyers expected to meet in Las Vegas to plan class action strategy. The US Food and Drug Administration estimates Vioxx could have caused more than 27,000 heart attacks. Merck income has dropped 29%.The European Medicines Agency and the US FDA vowed to review drugs in the same class as Vioxx. The FDA said over 27,000 deaths could be attributed to Vioxx. Lancet concluded Merck and the FDA should have withdrawn Vioxx. Many new individual and class action Vioxx lawsuits were filed in the US and Canada, representing patients, Merck shareholders, and former employees with company retirement plans. Radio ads sought plaintiffs for class action suits. Merck requested that one judge handle all the lawsuits. Plaintiffs' lawyers planned to meet in Las Vegas to lay groundwork.

Apple would switch to Intel chips for some of its Macintosh computers in 2006, all by 2007. IBM, its supplier for 14 years, was unable to deliver its new PC chip that promised more power and less heat, both needed for laptops Apple planned. The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games.Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple has been frustrated by IBMs failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat. After weeks of rumors, Jobs announced that the switch would be made by 2007. Apple must now persuade software developers to make their programs run on Intel chips. Apple's operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows. Intel's CEO said his company is thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer.Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple's annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors. Apple engineers have secretly worked on a transition for five years. Every edition of Macintosh OS X since then has been designed to run on both IBM and Intel chips. Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both chips. Apple's lower-end computers, like the Mac Mini, will get Intel chips in June 2006. Apple's entire computer line will have them by December 2007.On 6 June Apple Computer announced plans to abandon its 14-year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating. Apple programs will have to be rewritten to run on an Intel-powered Mac, although engineers have already developed codes to ease the transition. Apple could lose sales in the short term, as people wait for the switch. The first Intel-powered Macs are scheduled for June 2006; all Macs should be converted by the end of 2007.", "tree": ["(a / announce-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n

{"instance_id": "d0926-A", "summary": "Steve Fossett's attempt at the first around-the-world non-stop no-refueling solo flight began with takeoff of the Global Flyer from Salina (Kansas) Municipal Airport at 0047GMT on March 1, 2005. Fossett described takeoff as \"difficult\" as the aircraft was slower than he had expected. By 0400GMT he was over Canada where he experienced a GPS malfunction, but after a couple of hours it reengaged. At 1607GMT he was over Morocco and by 0330GMT March 2nd the Global Flyer was over the Arabian Sea heading east towards Karachi, Pakistan at about 390mph.Steve Fossett left Monday evening from Salina on a solo, nonstop, non-refueled flight around the world in the Global Flyer. He estimated flying time at 60-80 hours. He took off at 6:47 and was concerned for a brief moment when the plane seemed to lose altitude seconds after taking off. By 10 PM he approached Canadian airspace and soared toward the Atlantic Ocean. While flying across Canada Fossett's GPS malfunctioned. After a couple of hours the GSP corrected itself. Monitoring fuel usage was a critical challenge during the flight. Fossett flew over Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday.Steve Fossett, hopes to become the first person to fly solo, non-stop flight around the world without refueling. Fossett's plane, the Global Flyer, was designed by Burt Rutan and the flight is funded by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways. Departure depends on favorable weather. His plane does not carry enough fuel for the trip without tail winds. The flight will begin and terminate at Salina, Kansas. Fossettt hopes to make the trip in under 80 hours. The flight began at 6:47 PM on Monday, March 1st. By late Tuesday after overcoming a navigational equipment problem, he was approaching Pakistan.Steve Fossett and his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer arrived in Salina, Kansas, on January 7, 2005, to prepare for his solo, non-stop flight around the globe. He finally took off at 0047 GMT on Tuesday, March 1. By 0400, he was approaching Canadian air space after flying over Chicago and Detroit. He then flew over Canada and the Atlantic Ocean and was over Morocco at 1607. After flying over Africa, he was over the Arabian Sea, approaching Karachi, Pakistan, at 0330 on Wednesday.", "tree": ["(b / begin-01\n   :ARG1 (a / attempt-01\n            :ARG0 (p / person\n

He had been \"World News Tonight\" anchorman since 1983. By the end of the week, ABC had received 3,400 e-mails offering him prayers and good wishes. A former heavy smoker, Jennings had not been well for some time and was unable to travel abroad to cover foreign events. However, his diagnosis came as a surprise to him. ABC announced that Jennings would continue to anchor the news during chemotherapy treatment, but he was unable to do so.ABC announced on April 5, 2005 that its anchor on \"World News Tonight,\" Peter Jennings, has lung cancer. Jennings, who began chemotherapy the following week, had earlier missed overseas assignments, but was thought to be battling flu. Specialists suggested that the cancer is in an advanced stage. By the end of the week ABC had received more than 3,400 e-mails offering Jennings prayers and good wishes. On April 29 a statement from Jennings was read on \"World News Tonight\" thanking his good wishers who he said \"have spoiled me rotten\".ABC announced that \"World News Tonight\" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer. While making Jenning's condition public, the network did not provide details about the diagnosis or prognosis. Jennings, who quit smoking several years ago, will undergo chemotherapy in New York. He will continue to work on the newscast to the extent he can do so comfortably. Jennings wrote to his staff: \"There will be good days and bad\". Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late 1980s. He returned to regular smoking after the terrorist attacks in 2001 but later quit again.Peter Jennings hoarsely announced he had lung cancer on April 5, 2005 and would begin outpatient chemotherapy in New York.

Koslowski and Mark Swartz, former top executives of Tyco International Ltd., went on trial in New York a second time for stealing $600 million from the company. The first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors claim the two men illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders. A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges against Kozlowski with charges he failed to pay sales taxes on $13 million worth of art. If convicted, Koslowski and Swartz each could face 25 years in prison.The first grand larceny trial of former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and codefendant Mark Swartz ended in mistrial. Their retrial began January 18. They allegedly stole $600 million from the company in unauthorized compensation and the sale of inflated Tyco stock. Kozlowski could face 30 years in prison. Prosecutors are focusing less on Kozlowski's life of excess and more on how he allegedly looted the company. In opening arguments, the defense suggested the compensation was legitimate, and company directors might be practicing revisionist history. Kozlowski still faces separate tax, conspiracy, falsifying business records and evidence tampering charges.Former Tyco executive Dennis Kozlowski has been charged in a tax case with conspiracy, falsifying business records and tampering with evidence. He is accused of scheming with dealers to avoid paying over $1M tax on $13M of artworks. He and another Tyco executive, Mark Swartz, are also accused in a larceny case of looting over $600M from the company by illegally awarding themselves bonuses and concealing them from shareholders. A trial of the two ended in a hung jury. They are to be retried in New York. The judge refused separate trials.The first unfocused, lengthy trial of Tyco executives Kozlowski and Swartz for stealing $600 million from Tyco was aborted after juror intimidation. The judge ruled a claim on behalf of Tyco was barred under Bermuda law, but allowed a class action lawsuit by Tyco shareholders. He refused to separate the two men's cases or allegations of accounting fraud and looting. In the retrial, prosecutors are concentrating on accusations that the men hid unauthorized bonuses, secretly forgave loans to themselves, and lied about Tyco's finances to inflate stock before selling it. The defense is trying to discredit the board of directors.", "tree": ["(t / try-02\n   :ARG1 (a / and\n            :op1 (p / person\n                    :name (n / name\n

"One way to get rid of carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is to bury it. Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005.Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States, Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas. Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming.Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor, is not a new idea and is gaining support. In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground. Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe, reliable, and dependent on cost. The question arises if the process could cause an earthquake.Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996. Texas geologists are pumping compressed CO2 into a sandstone layer one mile beneath an old Louisiana-Texas oil field. CO2 from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is being pumped under a working Weyburn, Saskatchewan oilfield. Britain will pump CO2 from a Scottish power station to an old North Sea oil reservoir. The US backs carbon sequestration development and coal gasification technology that can sequester siphoned-off CO2, and plans to use carbon sequestration for mercury control.

Khan, Pakistan's revered father of its nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to black market dealings in nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned, but remains under house arrest. Recent investigations found evidence that Khan delivered bomb blueprints and weapons-grade enriched uranium to Iran. He sold warhead blueprints to Libya and possibly to North Korea. Evidence surfaced of his vast global enterprise, his facilities in Dubai and South Africa, and international connections from Asia to Africa. Pakistan's government expressed skepticism over recent claims and refuses to allow foreign authorities question Khan.Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales.A.Q. Khan sold nuclear bomb technology and material to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Possible motives were profit, ego, and a guarantee of Muslim influence. He traded centrifuge technology to China for bomb design. Pakistan claims to cooperate with the international community and put Khan under house arrest but won't let him be questioned. President Musharraf pardoned Khan, let him keep his profits, and denied government involvement. The US, not wanting to alienate ally Pakistan, quarreled with the IAEA and is investigating separately. Khan chief lieutenant Tahir is in jail. Khan's network operated in over 30 countries, including South Africa.A.Q. Khan headed an illicit, global, network, providing nuclear information and material to at least Libya, Iran, and North Korea. He visited other potential customers and uranium suppliers. He appears motivated by hatred of India, monetary gain, egotism, and pan-Muslim and anti-Western goals. The US had tracked him for years and pressured his confession to nuclear proliferation in 2004, but could not be too forceful because of Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror. The Pakistani government placed Khan under house arrest, but pardoned him because he is a national hero. It denied any official knowledge of his activities.", "tree": ["(a / admit-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1 \"A.\"\n                     :op2 \"Q.\"\n

Eritrea has enacted fines for all who import, produce, distribute, or sell them. Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda are all considering bans or taxes as are the citizens of San Francisco and Los Angeles. In Rwanda some citizens consider the government too hostile and ask \"what should we use instead\". A survey in San Francisco found about 1/3 supporting a tax, 1/3 opposed and 1/3 somewhat open minded. Grocers and plastic industry personnel are opposed while environmentalists support the tax.San Francisco is considering charging grocery stores 17 cents per bag. Grocers could keep half and use it on approved programs. Grocers and the plastics industry are opposed. Public reaction is mixed. State legislators defeated a 2 cent charge last year. Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Eritrea ban plastic bags or charge a fee or fine for their use. In Ireland plastic bag use dropped 90 percent. Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda are planning or considering banning or taxing plastic bags. Rwanda urges traditional basket use. Shop owners object. Tanzania is establishing a recycling plant.Governments around the world are taking steps to control the blight of plastic bags. Basic steps are collecting and recycling, education programs, clean-ups, and building recycling plants. Other nations are placing taxes or fees on the use of these bags. The \"plastax\" is common in Europe and decreased the use of plastic bags in Ireland by 90% in one year. California cities are investigating this tax. The strongest step is banning the importation, production, and distribution of these bags including enforcement and high fines. Producers and merchants are opposed to taxes and bans. The general population's reactions are mixed.Many countries including Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, Rwanda and Eritrea, have either banned plastic bags or charged a fee for their use. After Ireland imposed a fee of 15 cents a bag, their usage dropped by 90%. Some Rwandan shop owners have resorted to making bags out of newspapers. The U.S. has been slow to do anything. San Francisco was considering charging 17 cents a bag - a move opposed by grocers and the plastic industry. Los Angeles is considering a task force to consider ways to collect and recycle bags and to implement public education campaigns.", "tree": ["(b / ban-01\n   :ARG0 (a / and\n            :op1 (c /

"d0933-A", "summary": "Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk increases with the age of the father. Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects.There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia, but no complete theory. Children born of older fathers are at higher risk. No schizophrenia-causing gene has been identified, but a few victims display a gene-mutation associated with Rett syndrome. Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk, but the risk decreases with age. Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims. Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person's genome.Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and their fathers' age, demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age. Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain. A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana (also known as cannabis) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia. A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia's nongenetic aspects.The older the father, the greater children's risk of developing schizophrenia. Heavy marijuana use over years increases schizophrenia risk. Impaired thought processes in schizophrenics have been linked to a thinning outer layer of brain grey matter. The epigenome and a mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene each may be involved in schizophrenia. A detailed model of the brain's circuitry being developed in Switzerland, might help show why malfunctions that cause schizophrenia occur. DNA biopsy may allow testing for schizophrenia in utero and finding damaged genes in schizophrenics. A search of Iceland's comprehensive records failed to find a schizophrenia-causing gene.", "tree": ["(d / discover-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :ARG0-of (r / research-01)\n            :mod (c

"summary": "Concern for Yasser Arafat's health came to light around October 23, when a team of Tunisian doctors traveled to Ramallah examine him. Nearly daily conflicting reports of his condition followed. Possible ailments included the flu, a blood disease and cancer. On October 29, Arafat was flown to a military hospital near Paris. He was transferred to the intensive care unit on November 3. By November 9, a flurry of conflicting reports of his death, or near-death condition circulated. Palestinian factions met to discuss arrangements following his death. Israeli and Palestinian officials came to an agreement about his funeral arrangements.Yasser Arafat's wife controlled dissemination of information about his health. Reports differed on the severity of his illness and whether he was alive. He was transferred to a French military hospital near Paris. His condition later deteriorated. He suddenly went into a deep coma and death seemed imminent. Palestinian sources said he would be buried in the West Bank. Ariel Sharon said he could be buried in Gaza. Egypt might host the funeral services. Israeli and Palestinian officials met to discuss funeral arrangements but would not reveal them.On October 23, Tunisian doctors were allowed to see Yasser Arafat, who was hospitalized two days later. Rumors on his ailment and condition began spreading. On October 28, his move to a Paris hospital was approved. He entered the intensive care unit on November 3. As contradicting reports of his condition continued, rumors on his funeral and burial began to surface. Arafat supposedly wanted a Jerusalem grave. This is opposed by Israel, which wants burial in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian sources mentioned Ramallah. Egypt offered to host the funeral. Agreement among Palestinian and Israeli officials was reached on November 9.Yasser Arafat's health declined in late October and he was flown to a military hospital outside Paris on Friday 29 October. On Wednesday 3 November he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Since then there have been conflicting reports about whether or not he has died. Funeral plans were under discussion and the 13 main Palestinian factions met on Tuesday to discuss arrangements. Egypt might host funeral services. France reached an agreement with Israel for Arafat to be buried at his headquarters in Ramallah.

"d0935-A", "summary": "National League Nationals were named before they have approval to play in Washington and a new owner. Major League baseball remains the owner of the Montreal Expos. The team will play at RFK stadium for its first three seasons. Settlement of a financing plan for a new ballpark led to the approval of the move of The Expos to DC. The Washington Nationals will debut in an exhibition game against the New York Mets in Florida. The first regular season home game will be on April 14. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington.Major League Baseball owners conditionally approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos, to be called the Nationals, to Washington DC in 2005. No owner was in place. Mayor Anthony Williams pledged that DC would build a new ballpark. The first three seasons the team would play at RFK Stadium. City Council chairman Linda Cropp insisted half the construction cost be paid for privately but a compromise was reached. The Cleveland-based Gates Group offered $100 million in return for parking revenues. Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos claimed a monopoly on regional baseball broadcasting. Public resentment grew concerning the high stadium cost.After 33 years of no baseball, in late December 2004, all parties agreed to move the Montreal Expos baseball team to Washington, D.C. After many snags, Mayor Williams reached a compromise approved by both Major League Baseball and the city council. The team, renamed the Nationals, will play in RFK Stadium until a city-financed, $500-million stadium is completed for the 2008 season. The Nationals sold 20,000 season tickets. They will play the first game in Washington on April 3 and the first regular season game there on the 14th. President Bush will attend. The Orioles owner continues to threaten litigation.Major league baseball owners approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., on 3 December if the DC government could provide funding for a new ballpark by 31 December. An agreement was reached on 22 December for a 400-million-dollar stadium. The new Washington Nationals would play in RFK Stadium until the new ballpark could be built. The Nationals won their first exhibition game in Florida on 22 March, defeating the NY Mets 5-3, and were scheduled to make their DC debut in an exhibition game against the Mets at RFK stadium on 3

Supreme Court effective upon confirmation of her successor. Minutes after the announcement political leaders and lobby groups prepared for the ensuing battle. Liberals did not want an \"extremist\" and Republicans wanted a judge who would apply rather than interpret the Constitution. President Bush's choice of a judge was important because of key cases in abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights. One of the difficulties in nominating a judge is that they do not always vote the way one would assume, given their political affiliation or ideology.Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the US Supreme Court, is retiring. She gave no reason but a Court spokesman indicated her need to spend more time with her husband who has Alzheimer's. O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Court was considered a conservative when seated but became more moderate over the years. President Reagan appointed her in 1981. President Bush now has his first opportunity to nominate someone to the high court and promises to do so in a timely manner. Liberals warned against picking an \"extremist\" while Republicans argued for a strict conservative.Sandra O'Connor, 75, appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan in 1981 and first woman on the court, announced her retirement, effective on confirmation of her successor. She will spend time with her Alzheimer's-patient husband. Bush promised to be deliberate, thorough, and timely in choosing a successor; to have no litmus test on abortion or gay marriage; and to pick a strict constitutionist who will not legislate from the bench. This first vacancy in 11 years gives Bush the chance to shape court ideological balance. O'Connor was a frequent swing vote. Bush chastised critics of Alberto Gonzales as a candidate.July 1, 2005 Supreme Court Justice O'Connor resigned, effective with the confirmation of her successor. One of only two female justices, she gave no reason. She is 75, has served 24 years, and her husband has Alzheimer's disease. President Bush began a \"deliberate and thorough\" hunt for a replacement. Liberals warned him to avoid an extremist, while conservatives urged him to pick a strict constructionist. Four male federal judges and the Attorney General were mentioned. Abortion is a key question. Many discussed past appointments where a justice surprised the president by making a shift - to the right or left.", "tree": ["(a / announce-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n

This added to the uproar caused by the shooting and by Cheney's staff delaying a report of the incident for 20 hours. Cheney accidentally sprayed Whittington with bird shot in the face, neck and chest while they hunted on a ranch in south Texas. Whittington, 78, a prominent lawyer, was treated on the scene by Cheney's medical detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was in stable condition the next day. Cheney was apologetic.On Feb. 11, 2006 Vice President Cheney shot a hunting companion in Texas. Cheney turned and fired at a covey of birds, not realizing that his friend, Whittington, was in the line of fire. Whittington was immediately treated and hospitalized. The accident was reported by a local newspaper the following day and only then did Cheney's office confirm the event, 20 hours after it happened. Controversy surrounds the event. Who was at fault? Why didn't the White House announce the accident sooner? Cheney handled the matter of an illegal hunting license by mailing a $7 check to Texas.Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner on February 11 during a weekend quail hunting trip in Texas. Cheney's friend, attorney Harry Whittington from Austin, was sprayed in the face, neck, and chest with birdshot. Whittington was reported to be in stable condition in a Corpus Christi hospital. The incident was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Cheney's office disclosed the accident 20 hours after it occurred. White House staff was criticized for the delay. The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and late night comedians.On a Texas ranch on February 11, 2006, Vice President Cheney accidentally shot a hunting companion, Harry Whittington, 78. Whittington, peppered on the right side, received emergency care and then was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was moved from the intensive care unit on February 13. Eyewitnesses said the shooting was Whittington's fault. Although the White House was notified within hours, the news was not made public until nearly 20 hours, when, with Cheney's permission, the ranch hostess alerted the local press.

appointed in December 2004 to lead the project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attack on New York's World Trade Center. They were to be directors of the foundation that would construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial. Architect Michael Arad's design was chosen from 5,201 entries in an international competition. It featured two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens. Part of the $500 million in financing will come from New York's $816 million in federal grants.The World Trade Center Foundation held its first meeting on January 6. Its priority is raising $500 million to build a memorial and two cultural buildings. The four living former US presidents are honorary directors. Prominent foundation members include Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller, and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney. Michael Arad's design, Reflecting Absence, was chosen for the memorial. It is planned to include a forest of oak trees and a Memorial Hall. An underground interpretive center will house artifacts from the 1993 and 2001 attacks. The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.The task of raising $500M for the World Trade Center memorial will fall to foundation made up of leaders from finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media celebrities and relatives of 9/11 victims. All four living ex-presidents of the US have agreed to become honorary directors of the project. The foundation is accepting all levels of gifts. Governor Pataki said financing of the memorial should be the top priority for allocating money from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's $816M grant. The WTC memorial named \"Reflecting Absence\" features two reflecting pools surround by gardens. It was chosen from 5201 entries.In December 2004, 31 people were named to the board of directors of the World Trade Center (WTC) Memorial Foundation. This is a non-profit corporation to oversee fundraising and construction, then own and operate the memorial on the WTC site. The memorial will have a plaza, fountains, ramps, building and human remains, names of victims, and fragments of the 1993 memorial. There also will be an interpretation center, museum and arts center. Its completion is scheduled for 2009. The foundation is faced with raising almost 1/2 billion dollars and overseeing the reconciliation of the architectural vision with the physical realities.", "tree": ["(ii / include-91\n    :ARG1 (a /

It set off a collision that derailed two trains, killed at least 10 people and injured nearly 200. Witnesses identified Alvarez and he was detained. He was distraught and put on suicide watch. Glendale police believed he intended to commit suicide but changed his mind. He was taken into custody and charged with at least 10 counts of homicide. Investigators felt Alvarez wanted to kill himself because his estranged wife denied him visits with his children. He was held on suspicion of murder in Los Angeles without bail.A man intent on suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale, California, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains and killed ten people (later raised to eleven) and injured nearly 200. Police held Juan Manuel Alvarez on ten counts of murder and indicated that he had intended suicide but changed his mind and fled his vehicle before the train struck. Alvarez, who had self-inflicted superficial wounds, remained at the scene and was cooperating with police. He has a criminal record involving drugs and his wife obtained a restraining order against him.Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his SUV onto Glendale train tracks in a suicide attempt. When his SUV got stuck between the tracks he got out and left. A southbound Metrolink commuter train crashed into the immovable SUV and climbed over it. The front cab car rammed into an adjacent stationary Union Pacific work train and toppled it. The remaining cars jackknifed and derailed a northbound Metrolink commuter train. The accident and subsequent fire killed 11 and injured 200. Alvarez watched the crash then attempted suicide again by slashing his wrists and stabbing himself. He was arrested and charged with homicide.A train crash in Glendale, California, on 26 January killed 11 people and injured close to 200, many critically. A southbound commuter train, pushed from behind by a locomotive, hit an SUV lodged on the tracks, then hit a freight train and a northbound commuter train. Police arrested Juan Manuel Alvarez, the driver of the SUV, who had jumped from the car just before the impact. At first, self-inflicted wounds on his wrists and chest led investigators to think that it was an attempted suicide. It was determined later that he got the wounds after he fled the scene.", "tree": ["(l / leave-11\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :name (n / name\n                     :op1 \"Juan\"\n

phases in the summer of 2005. Early to mid-August transportation would be available to some areas of the park. August-Sept 11 all public services would become available. Sept 12 the grand opening of the park and hotels would take place. On Aug 16 HKD will begin its rehearsals to which special guests will be invited. In September, HKD announced it would not cut its daily capacity of 30,000 visitors. On Sept 9 it was revealed that all tickets for the grand opening had been sold.The Hong Kong Disneyland was built by Walt Disney Company and the HKSA government in 2005 in three phases to ensure a smooth start. Disney consulted Chinese feng shui before building Disneyland and its influences were incorporated into the park's physical orientation, opening date, and local cultural considerations. Disneyland staged its rehearsal period for four weeks before opening for employee performance practice. While ticket sales were initially good, they were disappointing. The HKSAR government funded the bulk of the park and was positive about it initially. After a while they questioned whether it was a reasonable deal for them.Disney consulted feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland. Changes included tilting the site, orienting it to face water with mountains behind, and creating water fountains and 'no fire zones' in kitchens. Disney directed a massive marketing campaign at mainland China. A three-phased opening rehearsal would begin in early August and last about a month, to allow for familiarization and adjustment. Disney declined to cut maximum capacity of 30,000 despite complaints of crowds and long lines but removed shark fin soup from its menu after environmentalist complaints. Expensive hotel rates dampened mainland ticket sales. More hotel rooms were planned.Hong Kong Disneyland, a joint venture between Disney and the Hong Kong government, was scheduled to open on 12 September. Rehearsal days were staged for a month before opening, giving \"cast members\" a chance to practice their performances. Disneyland refused to reduce its daily maximum capacity of 30,000 despite complaints from early visitors about large crowds and long lines. All 16,000 opening day tickets were sold out. The park is vintage Disney, with aspects of local culture including feng shui, Asian foods, and signs in Chinese. Protests forced them to remove shark fin soup from their menus.", "tree": ["(s / schedule-01\n   :ARG1 (o / open-01\n            :ARG1 (a / amusement-park\n                     :name (n / name\n

{"instance_id": "d0941-A", "summary": "At 10:24 p.m. EST on December 24,2004, NASA's Deep Space tracking stations received a signal that the space probe, Huygens, had separated from its mothership to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Huygens would spend three weeks descending toward Titan, shooting pictures for 2-1/2 hours before hitting the surface. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has an atmosphere. During the seven years mothership Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached Huygens probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.After a seven-year journey, the Huygens space probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24, beginning its three-week, 2 million-mile free fall toward Saturn's moon Titan. It will remain dormant until January 14, when it will float to the moon's surface on parachutes, shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface. Scientists hope Huygens will confirm the assumption that Titan's atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth. The mission is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.Huygens is a 9-foot landing probe, built by the European Space Agency. It is riding on the Cassini spacecraft, launched from Cape Canaveral on October 15, 1997. Cassini flew twice past Venus, once past Earth, and once past Jupiter - 2.2 billion miles - before its first orbit around Saturn began on July 1, 2004. It continued these orbits until December 24. On that date, Huygens separated from the mother ship and began a forecasted 20-day, 2.5 million mile ballistic path to Titan, the most intriguing moon of Saturn. Huygens is designed to study Titan's atmosphere and take photographs.The Huygens space probe, built and managed by the European Space Agency, was carried by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on a 7-year journey to Saturn. It separated successfully from Cassini on Christmas Eve and began a 2.5-million-mile 20-day descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, the only moon in the solar system that has atmosphere. During its descent it will sample Titan's atmosphere. Everything must work perfectly because there is no way to adjust Huygens' course. Progress was being carefully followed by NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the project.", "tree": ["(r / receive-01\n   :ARG0 (s / station\n            :name (n / name\n

anti-secession law was aimed at legalizing a mainland invasion of his country. It would undermine stabililty across the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan's President Chen. Taiwan sent six delegations to the U.S., Japan and EU countries the year before to brief officials on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations the law would have. Beijing said in March, that \"one country, two systems\" was its basic approach to Taiwan, outlining, for the first time, its anti-secession law that was being considered by the National People's Congress.Planned consideration of an Anti-secession Law (ASL) by China's National People's Congress (NPC) stirred strong reactions in Taiwan. Taiwanese see the bill as establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan. Furthermore, the ASC would diminish cross-Taiwan strait travel and restrict free expression of ideas, hindering cross-strait rapprochement. Taiwan claimed the support of the United States and European Union in opposing the measure. On March 8, 2005 as the NPC began deliberations on the bill, spokesmen defended the ASL as a means of promoting China's peaceful reunification on the basis of \"one country, two systems.\"The PRC claims the anti-secession law to be deliberated by its legislative body in March is aimed at promoting a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. It denies that it would be used to justify military action. The PRC maintains that the one country, two systems approach is best for Taiwan. Taiwan fears the anti-secession law is designed to legalize a Beijing military invasion. It says it is a provocation that would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. Its ruling and opposition parties agreed to adopt a resolution against the Beijing law. The US and EU support Taiwan's position.Taiwan considers the PRC's plan to enact an anti-secession law a provocative move to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Emphasizing that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC as Beijing claims, Taiwan believes the legislation is aimed at establishing a legal justification for Beijing's invasion of the island. The U.S. and E.U.consider the legislation counterproductive to peace. The PRC claims that the law is designed to check the secessionist activities of \"Taiwan independence\" forces and promote China's reunification. The PRC legislature is scheduled to take up the anti-secession law in March.", "tree": ["(s / say-01\n   :ARG0 (p / person\n            :ARG0-of (h / have-org-role-91\n                        :ARG1 (c

20 years later. Prosecutors charged that a millionaire named Malik and a millworker named Bagri were Sikhs taking revenge against the Indian government, which owned Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The prosecution's case rested upon their providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with investigations, and admissions to people they trusted. Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses. There were years of bungled police work and unexplained killings of witnesses.Two Sikhs, Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri, were charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 passengers and with killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport. Final arguments in their murder trial concluded in December 2004. Prosecutors believe the Sikhs' motive was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The trial was not settled due to years of bungled police work, unexpected killings of witnesses and a suspect, and vague and contradictory testimonies. Justice Ian Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will deliver his decision in March 2005.Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri have been in custody over four years accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet in June 1985 killing 329 people. Prosecutors believe the two British Columbia-based Sikh extremists acted in revenge against the Indian government for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The trial is being held in a bomb-proof court built especially for this trial, the largest and most complex in Canadian history. More than 100 witnesses have testified. Some key witnesses have offered vague and contradictory recollections. Two potential witnesses were assassinated and others received threats. Key evidence is circumstantial.Final arguments were presented in the British Columbian trial of two Indian Sikh immigrants accused of involvement in two bombings: an Air India jet which exploded off the Irish coast in 1985, killing all 329 aboard; and a bomb that killed two baggage handlers in Tokyo. The prosecution held that the men wanted revenge against the Indian government for attacking Sikhdom's most holy temple in 1984. The defense argued against the credibility of three key witnesses. There is no physical evidence or first-hand testimony linking the suspects to the bombings. The judge will deliver a decision on 16 March.", "tree": ["(b / bomb-01\n   :ARG0 m\n   :ARG1 (j / jet\n            :poss (c / company\n                     :name (n / name\n

a chance to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by 16-17-year-olds. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be \"swing votes.\" In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that \"world opinion is against us\" in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18.On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal.The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states.In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles. Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged.", "tree": ["(p / present-01\n   :ARG0 (c / court-decision\n
