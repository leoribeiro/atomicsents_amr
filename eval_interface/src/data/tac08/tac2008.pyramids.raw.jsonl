["Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.", "Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.", "In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.", "The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate."], "summarizer_ids": ["A", "C", "E", "H"]}

By January 2005 the Christian minority was organized into political parties in preparation for the January 30th parliamentary elections. On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.", "Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004. Insurgents abducted a Syrian Catholic Archbishop apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians in upcoming elections. Former Archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign to assure the future of Iraqi Christian community. Their rights should be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and financial aid given for return to their lands and homes.", "Assyrian Christians in Iraq date to the pre-Islamic first century. Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.", "Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors. In mid-January, just before the upcoming elections, a Catholic archbishop was kidnapped by gunmen in Mosul."], "summarizer_ids": ["B", "E", "G", "H"]}

North Korea demands to be treated as a nuclear power and for disarmament talks to apply to all countries involved.

In May the IAEA reported N.K. had close to six nuclear weapons. N.K. and S.K. resumed direct talks. In July N.K. returned to six-nation talks after the U.S. recognized N.K.'s sovereignty. S.K. offered N.K. food, electricity, APEC membership, a multinational rehabilitation fund, and to establish a Northeast Asian Development Bank, if N.K. abandons nuclear weapons, which the U.S. called \"premature\". N.K. said it would return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after its nuclear weapons program was resolved.", "North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after the United States accused the country of having a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it has already built nuclear bombs.

South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia want North Korea to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. Pyongyang insists on having nuclear power for peaceful purposes, something opposed by the U.S. South Korea has promised massive aid to North Korea, including electricity, rice, and other necessities, if an agreement can be reached within the six-party framework.

Oct. 27, 2005. Cars were torched, windows smashed, and policemen stoned. On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.", "On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.", "Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.", "Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries."], "summarizer_ids": ["B", "C", "D", "F"]}

PM Tony Blair returned to London from the Group of Eight meeting in Scotland after the bombings. Police said each bomb contained less than ten pounds of military-grade explosives and did not rule out suicide bombers as responsible. A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility.", "Four coordinated bombs exploded in central London during morning rush hour on July 7th, coinciding with the G8 summit in Scotland. About 700 were injured and 52 killed. Three bombs were on subway trains and one on a bus. Each was small enough to fit in a rucksack. The Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility, to avenge British involvement in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. No evidence arose of suicide bombers. Investigators viewed video by cameras on streets and subway platforms around London. Londoners took the terrorist attacks in stride, used to IRA bombs and the WWII blitz.", "Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in London during the morning rush hour on Thursday 7 July. Bombs exploded on three subway trains and one double-decker bus. The bombs all contained similar components: military-grade explosives under 10 pounds, small enough to fit into a backpack. The explosions killed at least 52 people and injured more than 700. Investigations at the tunnel site were slow, hampered by very high heat, asbestos dust, and twisted metal. Investigators do not know how many suspects they are looking for, but reported progress toward identifying one of the bombers."], "summarizer_ids": ["D", "F", "G", "H"]}

The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal.

Olive oil suppresses oncogene Her-2/neu and boosts effectiveness of antibody Herceptin. Hypothyroidism and oral contraceptives reduce breast cancer risk.

The House majority leader and a congressman were implicated. On Nov. 18, 2005 Michael Scanlon was charged with fraud and scheduled to go to court on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information, typically a prelude to pleading guilty and giving full cooperation with government investigators.", "Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal. The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas. The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio. Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal. Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.", "The Senate Indian Affairs Committee charged Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and fund-raiser, with running a crude extortion racket that has bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, additional congressmen and House aides are under an ethics investigation resulting from their connections with Abramoff. His activities in the Northern Marianas are also being investigated. Abramoff has been indicated in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and his partner, Michael Scanlon, was charged with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars.", "Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff is being investigated in connection with manipulating elections and extorting lobbying fees of $66 million from six Indian tribes related to protecting gaming franchises, and $9 million from the Northern Mariana Islands related to the textile industry. Investigations also involve Abramoff's purchase of a gambling cruise ship company and arranging unreported golf junkets to Scotland. Abramoff invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Senate hearing. Also implicated are Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his former aide Michael Scanlon, Ralph Reed, Representative Robert W. Ney, and David Safavian.

On July 1 federal agents raided Cunningham's San Diego residence and the MZM offices and yacht in Washington. Cunningham soon announced that he would not seek reelection and the executive stepped down. On August 13 Cunningham asked donors for permission to use their campaign contributions for legal expenses.", "By July 2005 U.S. Representative Randall Cunningham was under investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the IRS and a federal grand jury probe. He received defense contractor MZM Inc's PAC money and personal donations from MZM President, Mitchell Wade. Wade paid a supposedly inflated price for Cunningham's and Cunningham paid Wade questionably little money to live on Wade's yacht in DC. Cunningham promoted MZM defense contracts, contributed to and served on a Wade-run charity board, and spoke at an MZM company party. Cunningham requested donors' permission to transfer campaign funds to his legal defense fund.", "The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating Rep. Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor, Mitchell Wade, for an inflated price. Agencies are probing Wade's efforts to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts. Cunningham was living on Wade's yacht, which has also raised questions about improper financial links. He defended his boat arrangement as proper saying that he paid fees and services in lieu of rent. Cunningham is asking his contributors, including Wade, for permission to use their campaign donations for his legal defense.", "Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham, R-California, is a favorite of defense contractors who contribute heavily to his political campaign. The CEO of one company, MZM, Mitchell Wade, contributes to Cunningham's campaign and PAC, but  supports the congressman in other ways. When in Washington, Cunningham lives aboard Wade's yacht docked at a Potomac River yacht club and pays only docking fees. Wade purchased Cunningham's home in San Diego for over  $1.6M and a few months later sold it for a $700,000 loss suggesting that Cunningham was paid an inflated price. After that sale, Cunningham bought another home for over $2.5M."], "summarizer_ids": ["B", "C", "E", "F"]}

Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone.

Taylor meddles in Liberian affairs, harbors members of Al-Qaeda, and ordered an assassination attempt against Guinea's President Conte. Nigerian President Obasanjo agreed to turn Taylor over to Liberia but is pressured to send him to war crimes court in Sierra Leone where Taylor is under indictment for crimes against humanity while backing rebels."], "summarizer_ids": ["A", "B", "C", "G"]}

The pipeline to Germany circumvents the concept of a common European policy with Russia. Russia has a monopoly agreement on gas exported from Kazakhstan produced in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russia's actions are viewed as applying political pressure on neighboring countries. The pipelines are expected to begin operating between 2007 and 2010.", "Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas group and the German company BASF plan a Baltic Sea pipeline to transport Russian gas directly to Europe. The pipeline will be launched in 2010, three years from the original estimate. It will make landfall in northern Germany then continue to the Netherlands and across the English Channel. Austria and Bulgaria plan a gas pipeline from Turkey through Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to Austria. Construction is to begin on a Turkey-Greece pipeline to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe. An underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy is part of the plan.", "Russia's Gazprom will control the Northern European Gas Pipeline, bringing Siberian gas directly to Europe. It will bypass Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, who fear being cut off from Russian gas. Gazprom and Germany's BASF will build it. Gerhard Schroeder, criticized for profiting from a project he supported while German chancellor, will chair the board. Gazprom arranged a monopoly on gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Kazakhstan. The Austria-Bulgaria \"Nabucco\" project is a gas pipeline from Turkey to Austria. A Southern Europe Gas Ring from Turkey through Greece and across the Ionian Sea to Italy is to be completed by 2006.", "The Northern European Gas Pipeline, which will bring gas from Northern Siberia through Russia and under the Baltic Sea to northern Germany, then to the Netherlands and under the English Channel to Britain. Poland, the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine are critical of the pipeline, because it bypasses current transit routes through those countries. The Southern Europe Gas Ring project is to transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea area and Central Asia through Turkey and Greece then under the Ionian Sea to Italy.

The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire \"inadequate,\" \"insufficient,\" and \"insulting.\"", "President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.", "President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.", "President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses \"inadequate\" and \"insulting\" and asked her to redo it."], "summarizer_ids": ["B", "E", "F", "H"]}

The opposition refused to accept a landslide victory by Akayev supporters in parliamentary elections and claimed fraud. They blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and took a governor and district chief hostage. When police fired shots to dispel rioters, crowds beat four policemen to death. Akayev ordered fraud claims investigated and replaced the interior minister and prosecutor-general.", "Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 27 February, with presidential elections planned for October. Akayev supporters won a landslide victory in most areas, but both opposition leaders and western observers cited mass violations. Run-off parliamentary elections were held in many regions on 13 March. The opposition was defeated but refused to accept the results and demanded Akayev's resignation. Even before the election, opposition leaders had been calling for Akayev to step down as President at the end of October in accordance with the constitution. But Akayev refused to resign or to annul the election results."], "summarizer_ids": ["B", "C", "G", "H"]}
