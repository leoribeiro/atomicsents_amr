    "summary": "The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.",

    "summary": "Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate.",

    "summary": "China sacrificed coal mine safety in its massive demand for energy. Gas explosions, flooding, fires, and cave-ins cause most accidents. The mining industry is riddled with corruption from mining officials to owners. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production. South Africa recently provided China with information on mining safety and technology during a conference. China is beginning enforcement of safety regulations. Over 12,000 mines have been ordered to suspend operations and 4,000 others ordered closed. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. China's mines are the most dangerous worldwide.Chinese coalmines are said to be the most dangerous in the world.  January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004.  Accidents included explosions, floods and cave-ins.  The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.China's accident-plagued coal mines cause thousands of deaths and injuries annually. 2004 saw over 6,000 mine deaths. January through August 2005, deaths rose 8.5% over the same period in 2004. Most accidents are gas explosions, but fires, floods, and cave-ins also occur. Ignored safety procedures, outdated equipment, and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem. Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill-managed and illegally-run mines, punishing errant owners, issuing new safety regulations and measures, and outlawing local officials from investing in mines. China also sought solutions at the Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held in Beijing.China will close 8,648 coal mines during October 2005, for renewal of safety certificates in view of the large number of mine accidents causing loss of life. During the first nine months of the year, there were 2337 accidents killing 4228 miners. Mine safety procedures have been ignored in the quest for profits, especially by those mines owned or partly-owned by local officials. A total of 4,578 officials admitted to having stakes in coal mines. China is seeking solutions from the world, especially South Africa, to improve mining safety. By November, 12,148 mines were ordered shut down for recertification.",

The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit.

Of 40 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 28 million will enter Part D.Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit, which becomes effective January 1, 2006, through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA).

Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, intervened for the parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused involvement. State rulings for the husband ordered the immediate removal of Shiavo's feeding tube. The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed \"Terri's law\" through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President.

On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004. Insurgents abducted a Syrian Catholic Archbishop apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians in upcoming elections. Former Archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign to assure the future of Iraqi Christian community. Their rights should be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and financial aid given for return to their lands and homes.Assyrian Christians in Iraq date to the pre-Islamic first century. Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors. In mid-January, just before the upcoming elections, a Catholic archbishop was kidnapped by gunmen in Mosul.",

It was charged that earnings were doctored to inflate executive compensation. Raines could possibly face not only loss of his position, but fines and prison for falsifying financial statements. On Dec. 15 the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie had indeed violated accounting rules. Lawmakers called for return of millions in executive bonuses. Raines received $14 million in salary and $25 million in incentive pay 2001-2003. Raines defended Fannie's accounting.As late as December 21, 2004, Franklin Raines was said to be still under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for alleged financial accounting manipulations at Fannie Mae. It is not clear if Raines himself was ever under criminal investigation related to criminal charges against Time Warner and AOL, which the two companies together paid over $500 million to settle in December 2004. Those charges stemmed from alleged fraudulent accounting practices dating back to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of AOL's audit committee.Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae is defending its accounting practices and disagrees with allegations that it violated rules to maximize executive bonuses. Fannie Mae will be investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faces litigation by shareholders. Raines and other executives could not only lose their jobs, but also face fines and prison for knowingly certifying false financial statements. They can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from sale of stock.Major concerns have arisen over the leadership and credibility of Fannie Mae's CEO Franklin Raines.

There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of \"planet.\" Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight \"inner\" planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. \"Planet\" has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.",

Democrats are threatening filibusters to block her confirmation because her judicial views are considered extreme. The Senate Judiciary Committee engaged in angry debates. Republicans are threatening the 'nuclear option' as a means to end any filibusters. Republicans dismissed a Democratic proposal because it did not include the removal of filibusters. Additional compromise talks ended unsuccessfully. A new proposed agreement would allow Democrats to filibuster only in extreme circumstances. A new confirmation vote date has not been determined.On April 21, 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to revive the long dormant nomination of Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Brown's nomination had been blocked by Democratic filibuster during President Bush's first term. Senate leaders began negotiations over various compromise proposals on handling judicial nominations with the Republican leaders threatening to rule out the filibuster. By May 17 it appeared that Brown's nomination would not reach the Senate floor for another week or perhaps not until after Memorial Day.In April 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved and sent for U.S. Senate confirmation, the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reid promised to filibuster against her. Republican Senate Majority leader Frist threatened a parliamentary maneuver to change Senate rules to permanently eliminate filibusters in judicial confirmations, including Supreme Court nominees. Six Republican Senators and six Democratic Senators considered a pact to vote to prevent judicial filibusters, except in \"extreme circumstances\", and defeat filibuster rule changes. The vote on Brown's confirmation was expected in late May.The long-dormant and controversial appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown will soon go before the Senate. Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called the nuclear option that would effectively outlaw filibusters. Moderate Democratic and Republican senators have been trying to work out a compromise that would enable confirmation votes to move forward without such a rule change, so far unsuccessfully. Democrats oppose her nomination, claiming she would advance extremist conservative views, particularly on issues regarding parental notification of abortions for minors. Republicans claim she is independent and hard-working, with an open mind and a lot of common sense.",

North Korea's position is that nuclear weapons are needed for their defense. The negotiations with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the UK and the US to persuade North Korea to cease its nuclear weapons programs are continuing without much progress. North Korea demands to be treated as a nuclear power and for disarmament talks to apply to all countries involved. South Korea has proposed that the international community aid North Korea economically and institute a rehabilitation program once the nuclear issue is resolved.In February 2005 North Korea declared it manufactured nuclear weapons and won't rejoin six-nation talks (North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, U.S.). In May the IAEA reported N.K. had close to six nuclear weapons. N.K. and S.K. resumed direct talks. In July N.K. returned to six-nation talks after the U.S. recognized N.K.'s sovereignty. S.K. offered N.K. food, electricity, APEC membership, a multinational rehabilitation fund, and to establish a Northeast Asian Development Bank, if N.K. abandons nuclear weapons, which the U.S. called \"premature\". N.K. said it would return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after its nuclear weapons program was resolved.North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after the United States accused the country of having a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it has already built nuclear bombs. Since 2003, the six-nation (United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia) talks have aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and economic benefits and security guarantees.Several rounds of six-party tallks on North Korea's nuclear program have broken down since August 2003 without an agreement. South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia want North Korea to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. Pyongyang insists on having nuclear power for peaceful purposes, something opposed by the U.S. South Korea has promised massive aid to North Korea, including electricity, rice, and other necessities, if an agreement can be reached within the six-party framework.

The French sports minister, the Tour de France director and the chief executive of the USCycling said that since the tests used as a basis for the charges were inadequate no action would be taken against the cyclist. A Texas scientist attributed Armstrong's performance to his modern training approach, not EPO. A specialist in the fight against doping in sports, however, suggested that Armstrong had used a range of banned substances.On May 23, 2005 sports newspaper L'Equip reported Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for the 1999 Tour de France, based on urine samples examined outside World Anti-Doping Agency protocols, but linked to Armstrong by L'Equip, in violation of WADA anonymity rules. Tour Director Leblanc accepted the charge uncritically, but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible. The French Sports Minister agreed. USA Cycling, Miguel Indurain, and Ed Coyle defended Armstrong. Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999. An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending. Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Armstrong used other banned substances.French newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. Armstrong strongly denied the charges and questioned the validity of the tests. USA Cycling, fellow cyclists, scientists and French fans have defended Armstrong. Defenders attacked the report as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound. Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated he had been doping. An Italian specialist believes Armstrong used other drugs, too. However, he has never been found guilty of doping.A French newspaper accused Lance Armstrong of using the illegal performance-enhancing drug, EPO in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. The laboratory conducting the tests couldn't confirm the samples were Armstrong's, but the newspaper said it decoded the labels from samples identifying Armstrong. Armstrong strongly denies this charge. The director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, who studied Armstrong's physiology from 1992 to 1999, stated that Armstrong's record winning streak is explained by his years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France.",

Hale is currently in federal prison awaiting sentencing for previously soliciting the murder of Lefkow. Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders. Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts. Hale denies any involvement in the murders.Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's husband and mother were murdered in their home on February 28. They died of multiple gunshot wounds between 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Evidence being analyzed includes broken window glass with a fingerprint, a bloody footprint, .22-caliber shell casings, a bloody mop and cigarette butts. Investigators released composite sketches of two men seen near the home on the day of the killings. A $50,000 reward is being offered for leads in the case. The prime suspect is domestic extremist Matthew Hale, convicted last year of soliciting her murder.

Killers entered her house, had her husband and mother lie on the basement floor, and shot each to death. Police and FBI investigated widely but focused on Hale and his violent supporters. Evidence included a window shard with a fingerprint, a bloody mop and shoeprint, cigarette butts, and 22-caliber shell casings.

On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries.",

The U.N. Chief, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France and Russia, called for full withdrawal. On March 5 the Syrian President promised pullback to the border. A top UN envoy on March 12 demanded a full withdrawal by April 30, a position supported by the European Union. By April 26 withdrawal was under way and the UN had sent a team to verify whether it was complete.UN Security Council Resolution 1559 mandated withdrawal of \"foreign forces\" (Syria's troops and intelligence agents) from Lebanon. After the February 14, 2005 assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri, Anon told Syria to withdraw before April, threatening sanctions. Egypt and Saudi Arabia asked Syria to withdraw by April 30, under the 1989 Taif Accord. Lebanon's pro-Syria government resigned March 1. On March 12 Anon sent envoy Roed-Larsen to Syria with an ultimatum. Syria pledged to withdraw all troops. EU Foreign Ministers asked Syria to rapidly implement its pledge.The February assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri put Syria under renewed pressure from the international community to abide by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The US, France and other European Union nations urged Syria to comply. Egypt and Saudi Arabia encouraged Syria to withdraw its troops by the U.N. deadline of April 30. Faced with a U.N. ultimatum, on April 3 Syria pledged to remove all troops and intelligence agents by April 30. The U.N. sent a team of inspectors to verify whether the withdrawal was complete at the end of April.The killing of Lebanon's former PM Rafiq Hariri renewed calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of Lebanon. Nine council members voted for the resolution, six abstained. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable for withdrawal of its troops. The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal.

    "summary": "The Ukrainian presidential election race to replace President Kuchma is close and competitive. Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter. Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt. No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations. Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the Prime Ministry.Ukraine's October 31 presidential elections reduced the candidates from 24 to two, pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovich and pro-west Viktor Yushchenko. The November 21 runoff election results are being disputed. Yushchenko is claiming Yanukovich's victory is the result of an illegal electoral commission decision and is demanding they be annulled. While campaigning, Yushchenko was struck by a mysterious illness in September and spent most of the month in an Austrian hospital. He and his supporters believe he was poisoned by political rivals. Doctors are still examining blood and other samples to determine the cause. They expect him to make a full recovery.Ukrainian presidential elections were extremely close between the two leading candidates, pro-West Yushchenko and pro-Russia Yanukovich. Runoff elections on 21 November resulted in a standoff, with Yushchenko refusing to recognize Yanukovich as President and calling for new elections, and with Yanukovich saying that he would appoint Yushchenko Prime Minister. In September Yushchenko was treated in Vienna for a mysterious illness which paralyzed and scarred part of his face. Supporters claimed that the illness, which occurred after a meeting with the former head of the KGB, was an assassination attempt. Doctors said that they did not know the cause.",

Forensic experts studied DNA swabs that Kansas Governor Sibelius says linked Rader (BTK) to his victims. Little else has been revealed as to how the perpetrator of these crimes was identified and tracked down.After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas \"BTK serial killer\", Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005. He was held for 10 first-degree murders, from 1974 to 1991, but won't get Kansas's death penalty instituted in 1994. Local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI worked 31 years on 5,000 tips and evidence provided by BTK: eight letters to police and media, a victim's necklace BTK gave to his girl friend, a victim's driver's license, BTK's recorded voice and crime scene semen, thousands of DNA swabs, BTK's DNA linking to Rader, and facts matching Rader's biography.Wichita police arrested the BTK strangler during a traffic stop on February 25.

In March 2004, he mailed evidence of a previously unattributed 1986 murder to the Wichita Eagle. More letters, clues and evidence followed. Thousands of tips poured in and police received help from forensics experts. Police long believed BTK graduated from Wichita State University, as Rader had. DNA evidence helped solve the case. Police learned of the last two BTK victims upon his arrest.Wichita police announced the identification and arrest of serial killer BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill). He is Dennis Rader, a 59-year old church leader and government inspector who police believe murdered ten people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities for their inability to catch him. Police received more than 5,000 tips when BTK resurfaced in 2004 after two decades of silence. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation. Law enforcement officials revealed nothing about the evidence they have against Rader. According to Governor Sebelius DNA evidence linked him to crime scenes.",

Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena. The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient.

Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez are accused or suspected of steroid use. Caminiti claimed half the players used them. 5-7 percent of players tested positive in 2003 and 1-2 percent in 2005. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig investigated steroid use in 1998 and urged banning over-the-counter sales. A pamphlet in English and Spanish on steroids' effects was distributed to players.

Innovative bamboo products include: hardwood flooring, paneling, cabinets, countertops, utensils, plates, bowls, cutting boards, shower curtains, and products based on fiber, fiber pulps or veneers. Bamboo's has greater tensile strength than steel. It can be harvested every 3 to 5 years, but entire bamboo stands die-off every 60 years, threatening crop collapse and endangering China's endangered Giant Pandas, who are dependent on arrow bamboo.Bamboo has many uses. In the home, it is used for flooring, kitchen cabinets, counter tops, and chairs. India is allowing its islands that were struck by the tsunami, to build makeshift houses from bamboo and other woods, which can withstand quakes. Ethiopia hopes to optimize ways of producing bamboo to reduce poverty. Large areas of arrow bamboo provide food for giant pandas in northwest China. Now they are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo died. It takes 10-15 years for new plants to grow.Bamboo is increasing used for household items and furniture. Its main use remains as a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring. It has greater tensile strength than steel and costs less and lasts longer than oak flooring. It is environmentally friendly and sustainable since it grows fast and can be harvested within five years. Bamboo shoots are a traditional part of Asian cuisine but must be properly prepared to avoid causing harm. The bamboo plant is the staple panda food. But when the plant flowers and produces seeds, pandas will not eat it and are in danger of starving.Bamboo is used for flooring, paneling, and furnishings. Its tensile strength is greater than steel, it's harvestable in 3-5 years, and it's inexpensive. India makes bamboo housing for earthquake survivors. Ethiopia is developing its extensive bamboo commercially with China's help. A pulp mill for bamboo-like Arundo donax would benefit Alabama economically but residents fear the plant's invasiveness. California imported it for windbreaks. Giant pandas are increasing in China due to expanded bamboo forests and moving pandas when local bamboo flowers and becomes inedible. KFC in China substitutes bamboo shoots for coleslaw. Incorrect preparation of fresh shoots risks hydrogen cyanide exposure.",

A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that there is little difference between hand-held and hands-free device driver distraction. The survey confirms that cell-phone use while driving increases injuries and deaths.The District of Columbia, New York and New Jersey passed legislation that bans using hand-held cell phones while driving. More than 400,000 tickets and warnings have been issued since New York first enacted this law. New Mexico and Chicago City only allow hands-free cell phone. Texas is considering cell phone laws. An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety survey said using any cell phones while driving is dangerous. Drivers using cell phones are four times as likely to end up in a crash as drivers who didn't use a cell phone.Forty-five countries banned hand-held phone use while driving.

The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea. In March 2006 the new Liberian president requested Taylor be released to Sierra Leone vice Liberia. President Bush and Obasanjo were to discuss Taylor on March 29.Former Liberian President Charles Taylor fled to Nigeria in August 2003 and is under house arrest at a riverside villa in Calabar.

Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced. Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent. Terrorist attacks are being simulated using computer models. The 2005 Energy Bill calls for increased energy production and grid modernization.",

    "summary": "President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court caused much consternation. The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire \"inadequate,\" \"insufficient,\" and \"insulting.\"President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses \"inadequate\" and \"insulting\" and asked her to redo it.",

The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker.

Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed. There have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during more than 7,000 hours searching.The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp. Its existence has been confirmed by at least 8 sightings, a 4-second video, and its distinctive \"double-knock\" drumming. The first sighting was in February 2004 but was kept secret for over a year while experts confirmed the discovery and protected the bird's territory.

EU officials were there to observe the trial, the outcome of which could damage the Turkey's chances of joining the EU.Prominent Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk, was indicted over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres. Pamuk is charged under Turkey's penal code which carries a jail term of more than three years for a person who \"explicitly insults\" the Turkish republic. The European Union (EU) warned Turkey that its prosecution of Pamuk could damage its chance of joining the EU and is a test of Turkey's commitment to freedom of expression and reforms in its law. European countries, U.S. and activist organizations have criticized Turkey's lack of democratic principles and citizen's rights.In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage. He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for \"public denigration of the Turkish identity,\" carrying up to 3 years in jail.
