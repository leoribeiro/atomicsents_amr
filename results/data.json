    "Summary": "Prescription drug plan Medicare Part D has been launched with a bombardment of information to seniors. The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.",
