[{"instance_id": "d0801-A", "summary": "The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise.", "stus": ["The European Airbus A380 flew The European Airbus A380 maiden test flight", "The European Airbus A380 flew from France", "The European Airbus A380 flew 10 years after design development started", "The European Airbus A380 surpasses the Boeing 747", "The European Airbus A380 breaks Airbus monopoly", "Airlines worldwide placed orders", "airports may need modification", "airports may need to accommodate the weight and width of The European Airbus A380", "U.S. airlines not placed an order", "Airbus fallen behind", "Airbus fallen in production", "Airbus must sell at least 250 planes", "Airbus must sell to break even financially", "The European Airbus A380 is overweight", "modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget", "Additional test flights are planned .", "The European Airbus A380 is The A380 super - jumbo passenger jet", "Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months", "Emirate Airlines ordered before the first passenger A380 December 2000 launch", "In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380", "Thirteen non - American airlines placed 154 orders", "China and Hong Kong have options", "Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006", "Commercial deliveries begin to Singapore", "A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide , including New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Miami , Chicago , Dulles , Memphis and Anchorage", "25 airports worldwide including New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Miami , Chicago , Dulles , Memphis and Anchorage", "In February 2001 Airbus 's Hamburg plant expanded .", "Toulouse production started in January 2002", "In July 2003 Broughton , Wales got an Airbus 's plant", "The first A380 arrived in January 2005", "The first A380 arrived taking The first A380 maiden flight April 27", "The first A380 taking The first A380 maiden flight", "The first A380 taking April 27", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) took on The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) took ) maiden four - hour flight", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) took on April 27 , 2005", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) took in France", "The European company , Airbus , is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) is designed to carry 555 passengers", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) can expanded to 800 seats", "The European company , Airbus , stresses The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) fuel efficiency", "its maiden four - hour flight was successful", "Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received .", "No US airline ordered The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) yet", "First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006", "The largest passenger airliner ever built , the Airbus 380(A380 ) is the plane 's", "In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747", "Airbus engineering the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747", "Component production started in 2002", "Component production started in Germany and France", "A Toulouse , France assembly line opened in 2004", "new materials introduced to keep the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 at target weight but sent the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 over budget", "new materials sent the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747", "new materials sent over budget", "the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 was unveiled in January 2005", "the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 test flown in April", "Airports need to make design changes to accommodate the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747", "The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain", "The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise", "the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 is The A380 , carrying between 555 and 840 passengers ,", "the A380 , a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing 's 747 is this overlarge plane that boards on two levels"]}, {"instance_id": "d0802-A", "summary": "Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism.

Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt. There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of \"planet.\" Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight \"inner\" planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune.

former player revelations and the BALCO steroid distribution scandal. Steroids were banned by the League in 2004 but it did not include designer or precursor steroids. The new Anabolic Steroid Control Act makes steroid precursors controlled substances. Congressional hearings on steroid use are being held. Former and current team members and League officials are being called to testify, some by subpoena. The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient. Baseball executives and players union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for the current season.Major League Baseball players Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco admitted taking steroids. Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez are accused or suspected of steroid use. Caminiti claimed half the players used them. 5-7 percent of players tested positive in 2003 and 1-2 percent in 2005.

Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced. Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio.
