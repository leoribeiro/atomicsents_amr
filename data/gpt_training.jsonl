Forensic evidence indicates that each bomb contained less than 10 pounds of possibly military-grade high explosives, and all were made by a single bomb maker.

In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June. ->", "completion": " Inscribed monument case # Inscribed monument case in Texas # Inscribed monument on state capitol grounds # Supreme Court heard testimony on Ten Commandments display on government property # Supreme Court heard testimony on Ten Commandments display on government property on March 2, 2005 # Supreme Court heard two cases # ACLU claimed courthouse display modifications a sham # ACLU claimed courthouse displays unconstitutional because original purpose was religious # ACLU sued in courthouse display case # ACLU sued in Kentucky # Homeless man is former lawyer # Opinion will be issued by late June # Supporters say the Ten Commandments have secular functions # Supporters say the Ten Commandments are a symbol of law END\n"}

Armstrong strongly denies this charge.

{"prompt": "Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk increases with the age of the father. Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects. ->", "completion": " Swedish researchers have studied schizophrenia # Schizophrenia has a genetic component # A child's risk of schizophrenia increases with the father's age # Delaying parenthood is a trend in developed countries  # Chemical modification of a gene after birth is called the epigenome  # Heavy cannabis use can contribute to triggering schizophrenia # Cannabis use by teenagers carries risk of schizophrenia  END\n"}
